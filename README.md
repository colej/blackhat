This is a package dedicated to the classification of stellar varibility and transient signals
found in MeerLICHT and BlackGEM multi-colour photometry. We further develop the methodology of 
Boone 2019 to use multi-dimensional Gaussian Processes in order to provide real-time classification 
probabilities of identified ML/BG sources.
